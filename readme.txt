Install the Amazon Pay plugin for your WooCommerce store and take advantage of a seamless checkout experience

== Description ==

**What is Amazon Pay?** An end-to-end payment solution that gives hundreds of millions of active Amazon customers[1] a familiar, fast, and secure way to complete their purchase through your online store. Shoppers can use the address and payment information already stored in their Amazon account to check out – avoiding account creation or the need to re-enter their billing and shipping information. The performance is continually optimized by technology, learnings, and best practices from Amazon.

As earth’s most customer-centric company, we are continuously innovating on behalf of our customers. With 91% of Amazon Pay customers saying they would use Amazon Pay again and hundreds of millions of active Amazon customers already enabled for Amazon Pay, it can make it easier for you to deliver an improved customer experience online[2].
